# achlys
An project deigned to show what you are currently playing on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com).

Can be used for git instances (Github, Codeberg, Gitlab, ...) profile README's or websites!

Heavily inspired by [kittinan/spotify-github-profile](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile) & [JustTemmie/steam-presence](https://github.com/JustTemmie/steam-presence)

![achlys example](https://achlys.spf.lol/76561199104713718)

## Usage

Replace the `[user ID]` at https://achlys.spf.lol/[user ID] with your [user ID](#user-id).

## User ID

You can get your ID using https://www.steamidfinder.com and entering your username. Copy the text that comes just after the `steamID64 (Dec):`.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure that `Game Details` (or `My Profile`) is set to `Public`, otherwise Achlys cannot fetch your current Steam status.
